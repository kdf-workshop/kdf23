<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

We invite submissions of original contributions on methods, applications, and systems on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, with a focus on knowledge discovery and extraction in the financial services domain. The scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

- representation learning, distributed representations learning and encoding in natural language processing for financial documents;
- synthetic or genuine financial datasets and benchmarking baseline models;
- transfer learning application on financial data, knowledge distillation as a method for compression of pre-trained models or adaptation to financial datasets;
- search and question answering systems designed for financial corpora;
- named-entity disambiguation, recognition, relationship discovery, ontology learning and extraction in financial documents;
- knowledge alignment and integration from heterogeneous data;
- using multi-modal data in knowledge discovery for financial applications
- AI assisted data tagging and labeling;
- data acquisition, augmentation, feature engineering, and analysis for investment and risk management;
- automatic data extraction from financial fillings and quality verification; 
- event discovery from alternative data and impact on organization equity price;
- AI systems for relationship extraction and risk assessment from legal documents;
- accounting for Black-Swan events in knowledge discovery methods.

Although textual data is prevalent in a large amount of finance-related business problems, we also encourage submissions of studies or applications pertinent to finance using other types of unstructured data such as financial transactions, sensors, mobile devices, satellites, social media, etc.

<h2>Submissions</h2>

We invite submissions of relevant work that be of interest to the workshop. All submissions must be original contributions that have not been previously published and that are not currently under review by other conferences or journals. Submissions will be peer reviewed, **single-blinded**. Submissions will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, significance of impact, interest, clarity, relevance, and reproducibility. All submissions must follow the [AAAI-22 formatting guidelines, camera-ready style](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip). We accept two types of submissions - full research paper no longer than 8 pages (including references) and short/poster paper with 2-4 pages. Submission will be accepted via [EasyChair submission website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kdf22). For any submission questions, please write to the organizer at inquiry.kdf2022@easychair.org.

All accepted papers will be presented in the workshop. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop to present their work. All accepted papers will be posted on this website, and the authors may post their work on arXiv or other online repositories.
